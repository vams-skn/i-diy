# I.DIY! - A Project for Sustainability

I.DIY! is a web-based project built for [Nature Hacks 2024.](https://naturehacks.devpost.com/) 

Built around this year's theme of sustainability, this project aims to promote it by helping users instantly find DIY projects based on recyclables they have - cardboard boxes, plastic bottles, etc.

The site also has an interactive game that will test the player's trash sorting ability!

## Features

- Find videos to upcycle your reusable items.
- Play a Trash-Sorting game

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS: Custom and Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements

If time permits, I would like to work on the following features:
- Provide filtering options to allow users to filter videos by length, date uploaded, etc.
- Add more levels to the games section OR have it redirect to a new project that is solely for games related to sustainability.
- Extend the search function to also display relevant blogs with DIYs.
